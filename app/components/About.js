        <p>It all began when the IITian trio - Nikhil, Nittin, Sumit went hunting for a used bike during their
        college days. After facing a lot of problems and having a really tough time, they ended up buying a faulty
        set of two wheels. That very day, they swore to change the face of used bike buying.</p><p> Thus CredR hit the roads
        in Feb 2015 with an aim to transform the whole industry scenario. We went on to create a new-age used bike buying,
        selling and exchange experience through CredR. Today, we strive to be the ultimate community for all two-wheeler
        users.</p>
